<h1>I'm Joseph Blenke, a Student @ William & Mary</h1>

I’m a Data Science student concentrating in Spatial Data Analytics with a strong interest in global affairs.  
Having lived in six countries, I bring an international perspective to my work and studies.  
Currently, I’m using ArcGIS to explore how the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty may impact surrounding communities.  
I’m building my skills in Python, SQL, and HTML, and I’m actively seeking opportunities to apply them in meaningful ways.  
I'm also looking for resources and guidance to better navigate and grow within the tech space.
